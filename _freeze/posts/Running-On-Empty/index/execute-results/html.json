I know around this time teams usually start to either fall off, like Maryland, or start to just average out. But for teams like Penn State and Michigan who shouldn't be flat lining, this can become a concern. Penn State is trying to make a case for themselves to be in the top 4 even with a loss to Ohio State. Maybe we'll see if they beat them tomorrow and see if that can make case for them. However, Michigan and Ohio State are flat line and they are already in the top 4. Ohio State had a slight improvement since their last game but you can see in their chart that even with starting the season strong above the average rushing mean of the Big Ten, they dipped off in two weeks. Seemingly against Purdue and Wisconsin. They won both of those games and out rushed their opponent. I'm sure if we compared that to teams like FSU and Georgia, it might look different.  \n\nStart with Maryland, for example. Started off the year 5-0 and are currently 5-4 before the game against Nebraska. (Wish this assignment was due tomorrow especially with recent news with Michigan). Maryland's rushing average has taken a sharp turn since Oct. 15 and looks like it's on a spiral since then. Maryland had a season high of 4 turnovers during the Penn State game. Barely rushed the ball at all. Their downward spiral makes sense. \n",
